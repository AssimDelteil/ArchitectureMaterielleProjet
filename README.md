Hello, 

This project is about creating a processor from scratch with only logic gates with the software diglog.

This project is accompanied with a compiler to run scripts with the processor, the compiler was given to us so I can't share it.

You can get more info on the processor or on the language used by looking at the subject of this project, the infos on the language or the report.

Scripts are on tehe "code" folder, compiled script on the "code_compilé" folder and diglog circuit on the "circuits" folder.


If you have diglog and want to test, go to the "code_compilé" folder and run "diglog ../circuits/*.lgf". Then go to the page 4, select the first SRAM bloc and put the compiled code that you want to try (the .s.hi part). And put the .s.lo part on the second SRAM bloc. You can know start the programm by ticking the clock (manually or with the automatic clock).

This project was made in January 2022 by Assim DELTEIL.
